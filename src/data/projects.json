    "description": "In this project I used OpenGL and C++ to build a realistic fluid flow simulation. I did this by creating a grid arround a plane. This in the center of each cube in the grid there was a vector. These vectors, when given a direction and velocity could simulate a flow interaction. This was done by using Navierâ€“Stokes equations and setting differnt velocities and densities to the grid at each vector. ",

This engine uses OpenGL and C++ to render graphics to the screen, apply physiscs, procedurally generate planets and entire solar systems, and much more. Through this project I developed models and textures that were used to bring Project Space to life, I also assisted with developing the user interface and program the engine itself. My main role in Project Space was as Team Lead. I ensured that our project was subbmitted on time and all our capstone course work was done accurately and efficently.",
